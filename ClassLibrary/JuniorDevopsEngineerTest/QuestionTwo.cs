/*
    Given a string, construct a new string by rearranging the original string and deleting characters as needed.
    Return the alphabetically largest string that can be constructed respecting a limit as to how many consecutive characters can be the same.
    
    Alphabetically largest - this is when you compare strings z > a = true

    example:

    s = 'baccc'
    k = 2

    result = 'ccbca'

    The largest string, alphabetically, is 'cccba' but it is not allowed because 'c' appears more than k times consecutively.
    Therefor the result is 'ccbca'.

    Constraints:
    The string can only contain lowercase english letters.
    Max length of s is 10^5.
    Max of k 10^3.
