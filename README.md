# JuniorDevopsEngineerTest

This test contains 3 questions - Please attempt as many of them as you can in a maximum of 2 hours. 

If you are struggling to come up with a solution in the time feel free to write out in comments how you would structure your solution instead.

The premise of each question is different but the format is the same. There will be some failing tests to guide you initially with your solution. Feel free to add any additional tests to help your efforts to complete the solution.

It is open book in terms of searching for docs and help etc. However we are trying to gauge your problem solving skills here too so do not simply ask AI or google for the answers.

Please feel free to use any ide you are most comfortable with.

Please create a new repo using the "Use this template" button from viewing this repo in github. Please push your commits there.

The one dependency is the dotnet9 sdk: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0

To run the tests use the command:

'dotnet test'

Advice: Have a look at the questions straight away and then have a little think about your solutions before sitting down to complete the test.
